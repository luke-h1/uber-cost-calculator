## uber cost calculator

> A simple node script that takes in a csv file from uber's 'download your data' request and calculates how much you've spent over the lifetime of your account ðŸ™ˆ


### Getting started

1. Request + Download your data from uber (https://myprivacy.uber.com/privacy/exploreyourdata/download)
2. Unzip the uber data folder and copy the `trips_data.csv` and `eats_order_details.csv` files into the 'data' folder in 'src'
3. install dependencies with `pnpm i` - install pnpm if you don't have it already (https://pnpm.io/installation)
4. run the script with `pnpm start`
5. Open the console to see the total amount spent on trips and eats ðŸ™ˆ

### Contributing
Feel free to contribute! I've not accounted for all the different types of data that uber can return (i.e. I've not accounted for data that includes if you've worked for Uber). If you'd like to fix up the script for your own use case, please feel free to submit a PR! ðŸ™Œ
